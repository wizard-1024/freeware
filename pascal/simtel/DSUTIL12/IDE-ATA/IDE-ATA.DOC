------------------- Part 1 (Identification) ------------------------------

Program Name:			IDE-ATA.PAS
Version:			1
Release:			31
Date:				25 November 1993
History:			Original idea was found in the program
				written by Thomas J. Newman (1991) which is
				called IDE-INFO. I wrote my program because
				I found in July of 1992 the sowjet program
				IDE-BUS in which a stolen code from Newman's 
				IDE-INFO is present. I was angry. I like 
				neither a lie and a stealing. I wrote my own
				version with indication of original source.
				My Great Thanks to Thomas!
				I hope this version is reported about
				IDE-ATA drive all useful info what we need.
