Program Name:			HD-MBOOT.PAS
Version:			1
Release:			11
Date:				22 November 1993
History:			Written for internal use of author
				and his friends and all who no want lose
				hard disk parameters every time when CMOS
                                will disappeared
                                (Unhappy note: 
	                        I wrote this program when I had recovered data 
			        from hard disk of girl IRINA JAROWAYA.
				She came and taken back her recovered disk,
				and ... she was killed by mafia at the same 
				night. A Death on the two legs, but girl was 
				so young!
				Therefore I added a reminder screen and 
				her photo because I 'm man and a death comes
				to anyone at any moment without permission.)
